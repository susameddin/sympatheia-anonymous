"""
Independent second judge for the EMOTIONAL-query setting, using Google Gemini.

This is the Gemini counterpart to judge_qwen3omni_emotional.py. A judge from a
different model family guards against shared model-family bias with the
Qwen-heavy Sympatheia pipeline: Gemini listens to the same generated .wav audio
and rates it on the SAME 1-5 rubric with BYTE-IDENTICAL prompts, so the only
variable changed is the judge model.

Outputs are judge-tagged (judgments_gemini*.jsonl / summary_gemini*.json) and
written next to the manifest, so they can never overwrite the Qwen results.

Requires google-genai and GEMINI_API_KEY (see gemini_backend.py). Run from src/:

    GEMINI_API_KEY=... python -m eval.judge.judge_gemini_emotional \\
        --manifest /path/to/eval_emotional_.../manifest.jsonl \\
        --conditions finetuned_va

    # qwen3omni lives in its own manifest:
    GEMINI_API_KEY=... python -m eval.judge.judge_gemini_emotional \\
        --manifest /path/to/manifest_qwen3omni.jsonl --conditions qwen3omni

    # Smoke test (5 calls):
    GEMINI_API_KEY=... python -m eval.judge.judge_gemini_emotional \\
        --manifest /path/to/manifest.jsonl --conditions finetuned_va --limit 5

You are an expert evaluator of empathetic conversational AI. Your task is to \
rate how well a voice assistant's spoken response supports and empathizes with \
the user, given the user's emotional state.

Rate the response on a scale from 1 to 5 using this rubric:
  1 — Completely ignores or contradicts the user's emotion
  2 — Minimal acknowledgment, mostly generic or off-topic
  3 — Some empathy shown but inconsistent or superficial
  4 — Clear empathy and support, appropriate to the emotion
  5 — Excellent empathy: acknowledges emotion, validates, offers meaningful support

Respond with ONLY the rating number (1–5) followed by a vertical bar and a \
brief one-sentence justification.
Format exactly: <rating>|<justification>
Example: 4|The response acknowledges the user's frustration and offers calm, supportive guidance.\

JUDGE_SYSTEM_PROMPT_NEUTRAL = """\
You are an expert evaluator of conversational AI quality. Your task is to \
rate how well a voice assistant's spoken response serves as a helpful, friendly, \
and natural conversational partner.

IMPORTANT CONTEXT: The user's emotional state is NEUTRAL. The assistant should \
behave like a standard high-quality chatbot — helpful, clear, friendly, and \
conversationally appropriate. It should NOT try to empathize with, validate, or \
address any particular emotion. A good response simply answers the user's query \
in a natural, pleasant manner.

Rate the response on a scale from 1 to 5 using this rubric:
  1 — Unhelpful, incoherent, or inappropriate response
  2 — Somewhat relevant but unclear, awkward, or overly terse
  3 — Adequate response; addresses the query but lacks polish or warmth
  4 — Good response: clear, helpful, friendly, and conversationally natural
  5 — Excellent response: highly helpful, naturally friendly, well-structured, \
and pleasant to listen to

Respond with ONLY the rating number (1–5) followed by a vertical bar and a \
brief one-sentence justification.
Format exactly: <rating>|<justification>
Example: 4|The response clearly and warmly answers the user's question with relevant information.\
