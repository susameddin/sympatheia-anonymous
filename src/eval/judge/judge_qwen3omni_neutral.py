Judge model responses for emotion-adaptation quality using Qwen3-Omni.

This is the neutral-input variant of judge_qwen3omni.py.  The key difference
is the rubric: instead of rating empathy toward an emotionally expressive user,
the judge rates how well the model *adapts* to a *stated* emotion label when
the user's actual audio was neutral.

For each entry in a manifest.jsonl, Qwen3-Omni listens to each model's audio
response and rates how well it adapts to the stated emotion (1–5 scale).

Conditions judged (auto-detected from manifest):
  base, finetuned_va, finetuned_na, opens2s, qwen3omni

Outputs:
  <output-dir>/judgments.jsonl   — one record per (sample, condition)
  <output-dir>/summary.json      — aggregated mean/std per condition and emotion
  Prints a comparison table to stdout.

Usage:
    # Note: run this in the Qwen3-Omni environment (see https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen3)
    python -m eval.judge.judge_qwen3omni_neutral \\
        --manifest results/eval_neutral/manifest.jsonl

    # Judge only specific conditions:
    # Note: run this in the Qwen3-Omni environment (see https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen3)
    python -m eval.judge.judge_qwen3omni_neutral \\
        --manifest results/eval_neutral/manifest.jsonl \\
        --conditions base finetuned_va

    # Resume interrupted run:
    # Note: run this in the Qwen3-Omni environment (see https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen3)

You are an expert evaluator of emotion-adaptive conversational AI. Your task is to \

IMPORTANT CONTEXT: The user's audio input is emotionally NEUTRAL. The model was \

evaluating whether the model's response appropriately adapts to the stated emotion, \
NOT whether the user actually sounds emotional.

Rate the response on a scale from 1 to 5 using this rubric:
  1 — Response completely ignores the stated emotion, treats user as neutral
  2 — Minimal adaptation; response is mostly generic regardless of stated emotion
  3 — Some adaptation shown but inconsistent or superficial
  4 — Clear adaptation to the stated emotion; tone and content are appropriate
  5 — Excellent adaptation: response clearly tailored to the stated emotion with \
appropriate tone, word choice, and emotional support

Respond with ONLY the rating number (1-5) followed by a vertical bar and a \
brief one-sentence justification.
Format exactly: <rating>|<justification>
Example: 4|The response appropriately acknowledges the user's stated frustration and offers calm, supportive guidance.\

JUDGE_SYSTEM_PROMPT_NEUTRAL = """\
You are an expert evaluator of conversational AI quality. Your task is to \

IMPORTANT CONTEXT: The user's emotional state is NEUTRAL, and the model was \
correctly told the user is neutral. The assistant should behave like a standard \
high-quality chatbot — helpful, clear, friendly, and conversationally appropriate. \
It should NOT try to empathize with, validate, or address any particular emotion. \
A good response simply answers the user's query in a natural, pleasant manner.

Rate the response on a scale from 1 to 5 using this rubric:
  1 — Unhelpful, incoherent, or inappropriate response
  2 — Somewhat relevant but unclear, awkward, or overly terse
  3 — Adequate response; addresses the query but lacks polish or warmth
  4 — Good response: clear, helpful, friendly, and conversationally natural
  5 — Excellent response: highly helpful, naturally friendly, well-structured, \
and pleasant to listen to
