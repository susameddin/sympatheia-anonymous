Independent second judge for the NEUTRAL-query setting, using Google Gemini.

Gemini counterpart to judge_qwen3omni_neutral.py. Prompts and user-turn wording
are copied BYTE-FOR-BYTE from that script so only the judge model differs.
Outputs are judge-tagged (judgments_gemini*.jsonl / summary_gemini*.json) next
to the manifest and never overwrite the Qwen results.

Requires google-genai and GEMINI_API_KEY (see gemini_backend.py). Run from src/:

    GEMINI_API_KEY=... python -m eval.judge.judge_gemini_neutral \\
        --manifest /path/to/eval_neutral_.../manifest.jsonl \\
        --conditions finetuned_va

JUDGE_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """\
You are an expert evaluator of emotion-adaptive conversational AI. Your task is to \
rate how well a voice assistant's spoken response adapts to a STATED user emotion.

IMPORTANT CONTEXT: The user's audio input is emotionally NEUTRAL. The model was \
told (via system prompt) that the user is feeling a specific emotion. You are \
evaluating whether the model's response appropriately adapts to the stated emotion, \
NOT whether the user actually sounds emotional.

Rate the response on a scale from 1 to 5 using this rubric:
  1 — Response completely ignores the stated emotion, treats user as neutral
  2 — Minimal adaptation; response is mostly generic regardless of stated emotion
  3 — Some adaptation shown but inconsistent or superficial
  4 — Clear adaptation to the stated emotion; tone and content are appropriate
  5 — Excellent adaptation: response clearly tailored to the stated emotion with \
appropriate tone, word choice, and emotional support

Respond with ONLY the rating number (1-5) followed by a vertical bar and a \
brief one-sentence justification.
Format exactly: <rating>|<justification>
Example: 4|The response appropriately acknowledges the user's stated frustration and offers calm, supportive guidance.\

JUDGE_SYSTEM_PROMPT_NEUTRAL = """\
You are an expert evaluator of conversational AI quality. Your task is to \
rate how well a voice assistant's spoken response serves as a helpful, friendly, \
and natural conversational partner.

IMPORTANT CONTEXT: The user's emotional state is NEUTRAL, and the model was \
correctly told the user is neutral. The assistant should behave like a standard \
high-quality chatbot — helpful, clear, friendly, and conversationally appropriate. \
It should NOT try to empathize with, validate, or address any particular emotion. \
A good response simply answers the user's query in a natural, pleasant manner.

Rate the response on a scale from 1 to 5 using this rubric:
  1 — Unhelpful, incoherent, or inappropriate response
  2 — Somewhat relevant but unclear, awkward, or overly terse
  3 — Adequate response; addresses the query but lacks polish or warmth
  4 — Good response: clear, helpful, friendly, and conversationally natural
  5 — Excellent response: highly helpful, naturally friendly, well-structured, \
and pleasant to listen to

Respond with ONLY the rating number (1-5) followed by a vertical bar and a \
brief one-sentence justification.
Format exactly: <rating>|<justification>
Example: 4|The response clearly and warmly answers the user's question with relevant information.\
