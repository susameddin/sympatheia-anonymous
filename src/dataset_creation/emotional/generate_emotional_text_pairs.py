"""
Generate brand-new emotion-conditioned instruction-response text pairs using Qwen3-32B-Instruct.

Two-stage pipeline (following OpenS2S §3.2):
  Stage 1: Generate user instructions expressing the target emotion (thinking OFF)
  Stage 2: Generate empathetic assistant responses with thinking mode ON

Output format is identical to text_pairs_train.jsonl / text_pairs_eval.jsonl so the
existing TTS and GLM-4-Voice encoding steps work without modification.

Run with:
  # Note: run this in the Qwen3-TTS environment (see https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen3)
  python dataset_creation/emotional/generate_emotional_text_pairs.py \
      --llm-model Qwen/Qwen3-32B-Instruct \
