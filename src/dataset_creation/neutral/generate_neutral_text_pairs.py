"""
Generate Part 2 v2 of the Sympatheia dataset: neutral-only queries with
12 response emotions.

All queries are neutral (no emotional coloring). For each neutral query,
generate responses for all 12 target emotions. The VA label comes from the
response emotion, forcing the model to rely on the VA label rather than
the query audio's emotion.

Dataset counts:
  - 500 neutral queries × 12 response emotions = 6,000 pairs

Two-stage pipeline:
  Stage 1: Generate neutral user queries (thinking OFF)
  Stage 2: For each of 12 response emotions, generate a response that
           clearly addresses the user's emotional state (thinking ON)

Run (preview mode — inspect a few samples before full run):
  # Note: run this in the Qwen3-TTS environment (see https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen3)
